# Faux Frogger

This is a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger. The object of the game is to get your player from the grass to the water without colliding with the 'enemy'. Upon collision, the player returns to the starting point.


The game primarily uses JavaScript & canvas.


In order to play, fork and clone the repo, and open the index.html file. Use the arrow keys to move your player around the game board.
